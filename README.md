# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis Project builds a foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Learners will create a detailed blueprint for a booking management system, simulating real-world scenarios with a focus on clarity, precision, and structure to ensure successful project execution.
# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on understanding, documenting, and validating stakeholder needs. It helps define the project scope, reduces risks, improves communication, and ensures the software meets both functional and non-functional requirements. This phase lays a strong foundation for design, development, testing, and deployment, ensuring successful and high-quality software delivery.
