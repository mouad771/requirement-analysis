# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis Project builds a foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Learners will create a detailed blueprint for a booking management system, simulating real-world scenarios with a focus on clarity, precision, and structure to ensure successful project execution.
# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on understanding, documenting, and validating stakeholder needs. It helps define the project scope, reduces risks, improves communication, and ensures the software meets both functional and non-functional requirements. This phase lays a strong foundation for design, development, testing, and deployment, ensuring successful and high-quality software delivery.
# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Defines Project Scope
Clearly identifies what the software should and shouldn’t do, preventing scope creep.
2. Reduces Risks
Detects potential problems early, saving time and resources.
3. Improves Communication
Aligns stakeholders, developers, and testers on objectives and priorities.
# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
• Requirement Gathering – Collect information about stakeholder needs using interviews, surveys, and observations to capture all necessary requirements.
• Requirement Elicitation – Refine and uncover hidden requirements through discussions, brainstorming, workshops, and prototyping to fully understand expectations.
• Requirement Documentation – Record requirements in structured documents like SRS or use case documents to provide a reference for the team.
• Requirement Analysis and Modeling – Analyze requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, and use models (UML diagrams, flowcharts) to visualize system behavior.
• Requirement Validation – Verify that requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are complete, correct, and testable through reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping.
# Types of Requirements.
**Functional Requirements:** 
Examples for Booking Management System:
- Users can register and log in to their accounts. 
**Non-functional Requirements:**
Examples for Booking Management System:
- Performance: Page loads within 2 seconds for smooth user experience.
# Use Case Diagrams.
A Use Case Diagram is a type of diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) that visually represents the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and the system itself, showing what the system is supposed to do from the user’s perspective.
Use case diagrams help clarify requirements in a simple visual way, give a user-centered view, define system boundaries, and improve communication between stakeholders. They also simplify complex systems and provide a solid basis for documentation and testing.
